# Why this?
Over the years I try to organize my code as good as I can. Every few months I discover interesting plugins or take decisions based on my own experience with the objective of improve the way I work.
Sublime Text (and its awesome community) lets me code as I want, but since sometimes I use different systems to program (office, home, laptop, ...) I want to have a place where unify and update my configuration, and write a summary of the plugins that I use.

This is for me.
**But its also for you**, if you want to try (or want to get some ideas from) my development environment.
